betterAnvil
===========

A fork of Vdvman1's BetterAnvil Mod. There is no release for Minecraft 1.7.10. And after tweaking my tools using squidutils I find the Anvil XP costs have gone up significantly.  


I will be revising the math on costs of fixing Enchanted tools. I have a different vision then Vdvman1, in how the Anvil should work.

Features:
--------

* Repairing non-enchanted items does not cost XP.
* Renaming items is free.
* Anvils do not break.
* Removed the Prior Work penalty.
* Enchantability of the item will matter. 

 
 
I am thinking that items with higher Enchantability will receive a significant bonus repair amount. Or should it be cheaper to add Enchants to them?
